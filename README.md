# Race for the Presidency

A real-time strategy/roleplaying game that simulates the complex journey of running for President of the United States.

## NOTE

This is a work-in-progress personal project. While running this code will not harm your computer, I cannot guarantee it will run on every machine, and even if it does run then there's likely little to be seen. The game is very much in pre-alpha and everything is liable to change with later development. So have no expectations for what this game will actually do. Thanks :) âœ¨
